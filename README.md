# Surveyor

Surveyor is a self-hostable survey platform. The vision of this project is to create a website for creating surveys that has as much functionality as bigger players, but as the user you have the control of your data. Once completed, this platform can be used for surveys and quizzes, for the general public or inside an institution hosted on a local server accesible on the intranet.

** Note: This software is in early stages of development, currently functionality is limited, beware of dragons! **
